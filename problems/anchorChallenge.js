/**
 * Calculates the largest set of unique characters that can be removed from the given string
 *  with the string's final length being no less than 50 chars.
 * 
 * A brute force solution to this problem is to attempt to remove every character, keeping track of 
 * how many characters are removed with each possibility. From there, we can continue to try every valid 
 * combination of removal, exploring all possible valid (chars >= n) removals. 
 * 
 * A simpler solution is to calculate the frequencies of each character's appearance, keeping a sorted list
 * which we can iterate through to see how many unique characters can be removed before the paragraph 
 * becomes too short. 
 * 
 * Creating a "list" of ordered elements and inserting each character into it would take time complexity O(log k) for each
 *  unique character in the str k. Although inserting and sorting upon each unique character is the same overall runtime of just
 *  sorting a completely unordered list of the chars, in practice sorting the unordered list will be faster.
 * 
 * Assuming a standard alphabet, the sorting will take O(k log k) and the initial precalculation O(n), so the runtime of the
 *  algorithm will be O(n + k log k) where n is the length of the passed in string and k is the number of unique characters within
 *  the string. K will be a constant number, so the runtime can be simplified to O(n).
 * 
 * The space complexity is also dependant on the number of unique characters and is therefore O(1).
